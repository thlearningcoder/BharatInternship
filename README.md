# Bharat Internship
I have created projects on Number Recognition and Stock Prediction

## Titanic Classification
This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers, including socio-economic status (class), age, gender, and whether they survived or not. By analyzing this dataset and applying machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model that estimates a passenger's likelihood of surviving the disaster.

Key Features:
This code uses the following python libraries
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
Dataset Source: 
The dataset used in this project is based on the historical Titanic passenger data, which includes socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin location, ticket fare, and survival status.
Data Preprocessing: The code performs essential data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Binary Classification: The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0), making it a binary classification problem.



## Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset
This project is an implementation of a neural network-based handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. It serves as a practical example of image classification with deep learning. The project includes data loading, model creation, training, evaluation, and prediction capabilities. It's designed to recognize and classify scanned images of handwritten digits (0-9) accurately.

Key Features:

Utilizes a feedforward neural network with multiple layers for image classification.
Normalizes pixel values and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
Compiles and trains the model with labeled training data.
Evaluates model accuracy on a separate test dataset.
Allows users to make predictions on new handwritten digit images.
Visualizes predictions alongside the actual labels for easy interpretation.
